**Description :** In this project, I explored the oldest business in the world when they were founded, and which industries they belong to.Like many business problems, the data is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.  <br>
